      <h1>What is the DCMB?</h1>
      
      <h2>A Marching Band</h2>
      <p class="floatright"><img src="images/homepic.jpg" width="288" height="180"></p>
      <p> The Dartmouth College Marching Band is an integral part of many
        Dartmouth sporting events. In the fall, we open every home
        football game with a parade through Hanover, concerts at alumni
        events, a show on the field, the national anthem, and the alma
        mater. During games we keep the crowd
        lively by playing tunes in the stands, and go on the field again
        at halftime. After the game, if Dartmouth wins, we celebrate by
        marching through the library playing our school fight songs. In
        the winter, we continue to play as the <a href="pepBand.html">Pep
          Band!</a>
      </p>
      
      <h2>A Scatter Band</h2>
      <p> The DCMB has been a scatter band (sometimes called "scramble
        band") since the 1960's. Because we are a small school, we do not
        have the numbers it would take to do formal marching formations,
        like you might have done in high school. Instead, our shows are
        based around a humorous script collectively written each week by
        members of the band. We march out onto the field, but then we run
        into a formation that serves as a compliment or punch line to the
        jokes in the script. As a result we spent very little time on
        marching drill, and have a funny show that generally pokes fun at
        our opponents.
      </p>
      
      <h2>A Social Group</h2>
      <p>Band members do many things together in addition to playing and
        marching. Our social chairs arrange events including a
        potluck, a scavenger hunt, or anything else that seems
        fun. In the winter the band plays intramural hockey
        together. We're not great, but we have fun! Freshmen often make
        some of their first and closest friends in the band.
